The project here gives contents of the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* (Second Edition). It includes a variety of Jupyter notebooks and resources covering many aspects of machine learning (ML), such as:

1. **Machine Learning Basics**:
   - Notebooks like "01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb" and "02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb" introduce the landscape and a hands-on ML project.

2. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Topics like classification, linear models, support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble methods are covered in specific notebooks.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Includes dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning methods in notebooks like "08_dimensionality_reduction.ipynb" and "09_unsupervised_learning.ipynb".

4. **Deep Learning**:
   - Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and advanced topics like attention mechanisms and GANs are discussed in the later notebooks.

5. **Advanced Topics**:
   - Notebooks on reinforcement learning, autoencoders, and training large-scale models are present.

6. **Math & Tools**:
   - Some notebooks cover linear algebra, calculus, and essential tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
